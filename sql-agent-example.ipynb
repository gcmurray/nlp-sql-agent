      "; Declare memory location for character set bitmask\n",
      "org 129\n",
      "charSet_A:\n",

      "    and a ; Perform a bitwise AND operation with the accumulator itself. This leaves only the set bits in the accumulator.\n",
      "    pop af ; Restore the original value of register A\n",
      "    cp a ; Compare the accumulator against the contents of register A (the ASCII value to check)\n",
      "    ret nz ; Return if the two values are not equal, i.e., the character is not 'A'\n",
      "    ret ; Otherwise, return with Z flag set, indicating that the character is 'A'.\n",
